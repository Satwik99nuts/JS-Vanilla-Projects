Awesome 😄 — now you want to understand **each JavaScript word and term** like `querySelector`, `addEventListener`, `innerHTML`, etc.

Let’s go **step-by-step** like I’m explaining to a **10-year-old who’s learning programming** for the first time.
I’ll explain each word in your To-Do List JS code 💻👇

---

## 🧩 1. `let`

### 👉 What it does:

It’s how we **create a variable** — a small **box in the computer’s memory** to store information.

### 🧠 Example:

```js
let name = "Shaurya";
```

Means:

> "Make a box called name, and put the word ‘Shaurya’ inside it."

---

## 🧩 2. `document`

### 👉 What it is:

`document` means the **whole web page** that’s currently open in your browser.

You can think of it like:

> “Hey JavaScript, this is the paper (document) where all HTML elements live.”

So whenever you write `document.something`,
you’re telling the computer:

> “Look for something inside the webpage.”

---

## 🧩 3. `querySelector()`

### 👉 What it does:

It helps us **find** things on the page.

Think of it like a **magnifying glass 🔍** that searches for HTML elements.

Example:

```js
document.querySelector('.box1')
```

means:

> “Find the first thing on the page that has the class name `box1`.”

You can also use:

* `'#idname'` → to find by **id**
* `'.classname'` → to find by **class**
* `'tagname'` → to find by **tag**

### Example:

```js
document.querySelector('h1') // finds the <h1> tag
document.querySelector('#menu') // finds element with id="menu"
document.querySelector('.button') // finds element with class="button"
```

---

## 🧩 4. `function`

### 👉 What it does:

A **function** is like a **machine** that performs a task when you call it.

You give it a name, tell it what to do, and later you can “run” it as many times as you want.

### Example:

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
sayHello(); // runs the function
```

In your app:

```js
function htmlTemplate(todo) {
  return `<li>${todo} <span class="del">x</span></li>`;
}
```

means:

> “Make a machine that takes a word (the task) and returns a piece of HTML text.”

---

## 🧩 5. `return`

### 👉 What it does:

It gives back the **result** from a function.

Like a vending machine 🍫:

* You put in money (input)
* It gives you a chocolate (return)

Example:

```js
function double(num) {
  return num * 2;
}
```

Now `double(4)` gives back `8`.

---

## 🧩 6. `addEventListener()`

### 👉 What it does:

It tells your page:

> “Hey! When something happens, run this function!”

It **listens** for user actions like:

* `click`
* `submit`
* `mouseover`
* `keydown`

### Example:

```js
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert("You clicked me!");
});
```

In your app:

```js
form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
  ...
});
```

means:

> “When someone presses the + button (submits the form), do this code.”

---

## 🧩 7. `e` or `event`

### 👉 What it is:

Whenever an event happens (like clicking, typing, or submitting),
JavaScript gives us an **event object**, often named `e`.

It’s like a small note that says:

> “This is what just happened!”

You can use it to:

* Stop a form from refreshing (`e.preventDefault()`)
* See what element was clicked (`e.target`)
* Get information about keys, mouse position, etc.

---

## 🧩 8. `e.preventDefault()`

### 👉 What it does:

It means:

> “Don’t do the browser’s normal behavior.”

For example, normally when you submit a form, the page reloads.
But we don’t want that, because we’re handling it in JavaScript.

So we use:

```js
e.preventDefault();
```

to **stop** the reload.

---

## 🧩 9. `.value`

### 👉 What it does:

When you have an `<input>` element, `.value` gives you what the user typed in.

Example:

```js
let input = document.querySelector('input');
console.log(input.value);
```

If the person typed “Read a book”, it shows `"Read a book"` in the console.

---

## 🧩 10. `.trim()`

### 👉 What it does:

Removes **extra spaces** at the beginning or end of a text.

Example:

```js
"  Hello ".trim()  // becomes "Hello"
```

In your app, it keeps the task clean.

---

## 🧩 11. `.length`

### 👉 What it does:

Tells how many characters are in a string (word).

Example:

```js
"Hello".length  // gives 5
```

So we use it to check if someone typed something or left it blank:

```js
if (todo.length === 0) {
  alert("Please enter a task");
}
```

---

## 🧩 12. `.innerHTML`

### 👉 What it does:

It shows or changes the **HTML inside** an element.

Example:

```js
ul.innerHTML = "<li>Do homework</li>";
```

It puts this `<li>` inside the `<ul>`.

In your app:

```js
ul.innerHTML += li;
```

means:

> “Add this new task at the end of the list.”

---

## 🧩 13. `.reset()`

### 👉 What it does:

Clears all the inputs inside a form.

So after adding a task, the input box becomes empty again.

---

## 🧩 14. `.addEventListener('click', ...)`

### 👉 What it does:

Listens for clicks.

We used it for the delete button:

```js
ul.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
  if (e.target.classList.contains('del')) {
    e.target.parentElement.remove();
  }
});
```

Here’s how it works:

* `ul` = the big list
* When we click anywhere inside it, JavaScript checks:

  * “Was the thing clicked a delete button (`class="del"`)?”

If yes → remove the whole `<li>` (the task).

---

## 🧩 15. `.classList.contains()`

### 👉 What it does:

Checks if an element has a certain class name.

Example:

```js
e.target.classList.contains('del')
```

means:

> “Did the thing I clicked have the class `del`?”

If true, we know it’s the red ❌ button.

---

## 🧩 16. `.parentElement`

### 👉 What it does:

It means “go one step up” in the HTML tree.

Example:

```html
<li>Do homework <span class="del">x</span></li>
```

Here, the parent of `<span>` is `<li>`.

So:

```js
e.target.parentElement.remove();
```

means:

> “Remove the `<li>` that contains the delete button.”

---

## 🧩 17. `.remove()`

### 👉 What it does:

It **deletes** that element from the page.

Example:

```js
element.remove();
```

→ poof 💨 it’s gone!

---

## 🧩 18. `console.log()`

### 👉 What it does:

It just prints messages to the **console** (developer’s screen).

Used for checking what’s happening in your code.

Example:

```js
console.log("Task added!");
```
